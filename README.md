   cd SoleSuite
## Set Up Database  

1. **Import the SQL File**:  
   - Import the `database_test.zip` into your MySQL server after unzipping it:  
     - **Using phpMyAdmin**:  
       1. Open phpMyAdmin in your browser (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).  
       2. Create a new database (e.g., `solesuite`).  
       3. Select the newly created database, go to the "Import" tab, and upload the provided SQL file.  
     - **Using MySQL Command Line**:  
       ```bash
       mysql -u username -p database_name < file.sql
       ```  
       Replace `username` with your MySQL username, `database_name` with the desired database name, and `file.sql` with the SQL file's path.  

2. **Update Database Configuration**:  
   - Open the backend configuration file (e.g., `config.php`) in a text editor.  
   - Update the database connection details:  
     ```php
     <?php
     $host = "localhost";
     $username = "your_mysql_username";
     $password = "your_mysql_password";
     $dbname = "solesuite";

     // Create connection
     $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);

     // Check connection
     if ($conn->connect_error) {
         die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
     }
     ?>
     ```
